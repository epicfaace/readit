# readit
A quizbowl audio reader. Could be used for individual packet study by listening, or maybe even during practices and tournaments (in the future) as a replacement for readers.

# contribute
In the future, I will develop an online interface with which you can upload audio more easily. If you would like to contribute audio now, please upload or make a pull request on github and I will add it to the database. Thanks for your help!

# technologies
This uses node js and is hosted using Microsoft Azure. Planning on using websockets to speed up audio performance.
